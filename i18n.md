# static i18n

i18n = i<18-letters>n = general concept

l10n = l<10-letters>n = translation into a particular language

## Boilerplate

Boilerplate: `https://github.com/m8ms/boilr`

Using:

* webpack 4.16
* webpack-dev-server
* html-webpack-plugin
* react
* no HMR :(
* babel
* hereby offered **static i18n** (coming soon)

Others (irrelevant to this presentation):

* sass & mini-css-extract-plugin
* jest
* alt (flux)
* react-router
* eslint
* stylelint
* uglifyjs, optimize-css-assets

## packages

`yarn add i18n-webpack-plugin`
or
`npm i -D i18n-webpack-plugin`

## pros
* no overhead past build time:
    * no redundant locales shipped
    * no libs
    * no computation
* very easy to use
* locale files can be any format: `yml`, `json`, `properties`, `unicorn` or something crazy
* perfect when different locales are shipped at different servers and/or domains
* almost no config if other languages only planned in far future

## cons
* cannot be parametrized: `'marry created {0} issues'`
* webpack config ain't that obvious
* some files generated
* language change reloads page
* for decent development mode webpack 4 needed

## pitfalls

* static ain't dynamic... duh!

  `__('errors.http.' + code)` won't work
  use `__('errors.http').code` instead
* multiple webpack configs can result in drama
    * plugin instantiation
    * some loaders just fail, thus use sass-loader, not ~~fast-sass-loader~~
    * must take care of redundant build jobs like: _css, linting, file loads_

### dev version
* webpack 4.16 and latest webpack-dev-server
